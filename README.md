# UTTT-App
Application that allows you to play and analyze games of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.

Local Game - Play games with a friend in person, or input a game.  On the right side, moves will be displayed.  Above and to the left of the Moves List, is a Copy to Clipboard Button which lets you copy the game and paste elsewhere so you can save and record games. Use the Back and Forward Arrow Buttons to Navigate through the moves (cannot replace old moves).  Soon to be Added: Clocks, Names, Ability to Play Against Isohel z1, Functional Resign and Draw buttons

Analysis Board - Analyze games by inputting new lines to see different variations of the game.  Analyze which moves in the game were bad and good, and experiment to see which moves could've been better.  On the right side, moves will be displayed in cardinal notation.  Above and to the left of the Moves List, is a Copy to Clipboard Button which lets you copy the game and paste elsewhere so you can save and record games. Above and to the right of the Moves List, is an Input Button which lets you write or paste games in text form into the app, and you can then use the analysis board to analyze that game.  Use the Back and Forward Arrow Buttons to Navigate through the moves.

Board Editor - Input custom positions by deleting or adding pieces.  The buttons on the right change how you want to edit the board.  When changing the current tile, you can make the current tile free by clicking on a tile that's already the current tile.  
  - Keyboard Shortcut: LALT + Piece = places a piece like it was a game, automatically changing the edit value to the opposite color piece and changing the current tile accordingly.  
  - Keyboard Shortcut: LSHIFT + Delete = deletes all pieces within that tile.

Settings - Change the look of the board, pieces, highlights, move notation, and the background.  Settings will save in between sessions.
